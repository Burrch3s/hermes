# Hermes
### The script bringing you "motivational" posters from InspiroBot!!


Inspirobot is not written by me, check it out at http://inspirobot.me  !!!

#### So.. what is this?

This is just a small idea of mine that I decided to carry out; I figured if
I was going to go through with this idea, I might as well do it as best as I can!
Hermes is written in Python and should be run with Python3.
The goal of Hermes is to get motivational posters from inspirobot and present them
to you!


#### Setting up Hermes

simply `pip install -r requirements.txt` and you should be golden!
The requirements.txt file contains the python packages that are used in this
project, so if the above command doesn't work, try and manually install these
packages.


#### Running Hermes

**Under development, will be constantly changing.. probably**
Currently hermes only supports the command:

    `hermes.py now`
which will instruct hermes to grab a motivational poster from inspirobot and
immediately display it to the user!


#### Future stuff to do

Make install script so users don't even have to pip install -r

Add feature to schedule a poster to be presented later

Go through arg variables and add their functionality listed in hermes.py

Keep unittests up to date!! (Currently using green to run unittests and coverage)

Dont drop/forget about project, keep working at it!!
